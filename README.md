## The Todo List Project.

A fully functional Todo List Project.

The Eleventh project in the Javascript section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Spec and details for the assignment can be found [Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

## Features

* Todo List follows the SOLID Principle's Single Responsibility Principle. 
* Each function has precisely one job.
* Todo list uses ES6 Modules.
* This project also uses Webpack for the compilation.
* Unlike the restaurant project which had its HTML created using Javascript, Todo List contains HTML structure.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.
